	// Inheritance -> relation between classes (child-parent) so property can be inherited
	//	-> "extends" keyword in child class

// child class -> sub-class
// parent class -> super-class

// Types Inheritance: 
// 1. Single Inheritance: Child class <- Parent class
// 2. Multi-Layer Inheritance: grand child class <- Child class <- Parent class <- Grand Parent class
// 3. Herarichal Inheritance: child-1 <- Parent -> child-2
// 4. Multiple Inheritance: child class can't have multiple parent class, between classes is not available | between class and interface multiple inheritance is possible
